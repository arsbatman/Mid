In Clean Code, “Uncle Bob” Martin shares tips and examples on how to create better code. The book dives into the principles and best practices of writing clean code, and also presents increasingly challenging case studies presented that challenges readers to think about what’s right with the code, and what’s wrong with it. While examples in Clean Code are given in Java, but is applicable to nearly all programming languages.
                        <br>TIP: <em>Read Clean Code after getting through Code Complete since it deals with some of the same topics but at a higher level.</em><br><br></p>

The realization of the magnitude of Melville's talent did not come immediately, and only a quarter of a century after the death of the writer began to see the outlines of the enormous contribution he made to the treasury of world literature. The central work of Melville - the grandiose "Moby Dick" - became one of the peaks of American literature, finally depriving America of the status of "cultural desert". This edition includes, in addition to "Moby Dick", a number of the most significant stories and stories, giving an idea of ​​the versatility of Herman Melville's talent and his writing skills.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">LN Tolstoy's life, creative path, ideological searches captivate the minds of our contemporaries, who are trying to understand the very essence of the writer's work and his teachings. "War and Peace" is the pinnacle of LN Tolstoy's work. Tolstoy, like no other work of the writer, reflects the depth of his attitude and philosophy. This book is from the category of eternal ones, because it is about everything - about life and death, about love and honor, about courage and heroism, about glory and heroism, about war and peace. For the third century, the world's most famous novel by a genius writer has made readers empathize with the heroes of the work. The novel is about the Russian soul, about the Russian way of life, eternal questions that each person has to decide on their own. All the ups and downs of the heroes taking place against the background of historical events that took place in the early nineteenth century with Russia, against the background of the bloody events of the war of 1812, acquire a capacious philosophical meaning. The novel is still in the first place in all world literature in terms of depth and coverage of events.<br><br></p>

                      <p class="card-text">Who does not know "Hamlet"! But do not rush to put an exclamation mark. And even interrogative. Let's restrict ourselves to ellipsis. Since the experience of a close study of this issue shows: no one ... Before you is a book that in no case claims to be an unambiguously correct reading of the famous tragedy. But it lifts the veil over many of the things that have been haunting readers and viewers for nearly 400 years in a work written by the great English bard Shakespeare from Stratford. By the way, there are five factual errors in this sentence. Nobody knows "Hamlet" - is it not a bold statement in our enlightened age? Is it enlightened? Don't rush to draw conclusions. The most remarkable thing is that ignorance, or rather misunderstanding of the works signed by William Shakespeare, concerns not only the Russian reader, who is familiar with them through translations, which are far from always accurate, but also the native speakers of the modern English language themselves. In this book, the reader will find a new approach to translating the great tragedy, and a lot of interesting information about the customs, life and language of the English of Shakespeare's times.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">The story is told from the perspective of the main character, sailor Marlowe, who recalls his trip to Central Africa. On the instructions of the "Company" (the text is not named, but apparently, the Belgian company of the Free Congo is implied), he must arrive at a remote station to take with him one of the company's agents named Kurtz, who collects ivory. The main part of the book is occupied by a first-person story of Marlowe about his journey along a tropical river, among territories completely unknown to Europeans. His story is full of biased, but therefore no less creepy, details of both the life of the aborigines and the orders imposed in a distant colony. However, most of all, the main character terrifies Kurtz as the embodiment of primitive instincts that are hidden in the depths of every person's soul and which, if given free rein, will completely subjugate him.<br>
                      <em>Wilderness revenge brutally on Kurtz for the fanatical invasion. I think she whispered to him about him that he did not know, and this whisper enchanted him and echoed in him with a booming echo, for there was emptiness in his depths.<br><br></em></p>
